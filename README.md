# Thesis Acknowledgements: Towards a Systematic Approach

Writing acknowledgements at the end of an academic course is a transversal and highly growing problem, although in fact it is not recognized as such by the scientific community.
Choosing who to acknowledge, how, and in which order is a cognitively and temporally burdensome task, which often ends up creating discomfort both in the candidate and in the various familiar, sentimental, friendship, or work groups who are full of expectations in this regard.
In this paper, we propose a first systematic approach to the issue through a quantitative method based on the analysis of chats exchanged via the online messaging service Whatsapp.
Results show that the proposed methodology is effective, understandable, and highly generalizable.
